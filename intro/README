These are relatively brief introductions to various concepts in Perl 6.
Some are actually longish, but only because the subject matter is rather
large.

I'm starting with the things that interest me (after all, I'm the one
doing the work), and will move on to other topics from there.  I don't really
have a roadmap or layout of which topics I intend to cover, but I do know
that there will be primarily some longish topics first (regex, grammars,
smart matching, objects, etc.) and then later some not-so-long topics (meta-ops,
hyperops, gather/take, given/when, exception handling, etc.).  But, who
knows?  Maybe my estimation of the treatment each of these deserves as an
introduction could be *way* off.
