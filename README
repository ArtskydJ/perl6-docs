Documents relating to Perl 6

This repository is divided into several sections.

    * Introductions
    * Tutorials
    * Quick References

Introductions are explanatory but not comprehensive texts that give
enough detail to get someone started in a particular area.

Tutorials are directed, step-by-step expositions of some particular
aspect of Perl 6. They should take the reader from no knowledge to a
solid understanding of the subject matter.

Quick References are compact, terse, bits of information that can be
looked up quickly.
